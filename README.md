## Website
Link: http://artbycnstudio.com/

## About 
- Artist Network is an artwork sharing platform for artists to share their art online. 
- I want to provide artists with a space to share art without worrying about the existing algorithms on other social media platforms which are not intended for this purpose
- Users (Artists) will be able to create their own accounts and share their artwork and current piece for sale. 

## Features
- User authentication for users and admin 
- Users and admin will be able to sign up and login to their accounts 
- Passwords will be encrypted in the mongodb database
- Users and admin are able to upload artwork and sales, and have these posts visible on their individual Studio Space and Artist Alley pages
- Full CRUD for artwork and sales posts
- Only the account owner can create, edit, and delete their posts on their Studio Space and Artist Alley pages, but the admin has full CRUD capabilities on all posts
- Searching for artwork based on artist username
- A “Like Button” feature
